Instead of opening a new application as mentioned in the docs section 4. :

  > From the list of sample applications (Node.js, Python with Flask and    Django frameworks, Java, Go), choose a Hello World app.

    For example, choosing Python (Flask): Hello World creates a starter Python (Flask) Hello World app.

  Use the git clone command to get our bakery application:

  ```sh
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/GCP-Workshop-Bakery.git
  ```

  Open this project in the "Cloud Editor"
