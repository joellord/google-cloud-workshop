# Set up Google Cloud


:::tip
This section requires a Google Cloud account. You can create one and get $300 in free credits [here](https://cloud.google.com/free).
Alternatively, you can use this Google Cloud Skills Boost lab — [MongoDB Atlas with Natural Language API and Cloud Run](https://mdb.link/gc-lab-2). When you start the lab, you'll get access to a temporary Google Cloud account that you can use for the duration of the lab.
:::


In this section, we'll be using the Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyze the sentiment of the comments left on the cakes in the web app. That's why we need to set up a Google Cloud account and project.

1. Sign in to [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started) and create a new project.

    <img
        alt="Select project dropdown in Google Cloud"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-3-nlp/select-project.png')}
        width="500"
    />

    <img
        alt="Dialog box in Google Cloud highlighting the 'New Project' button"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-3-nlp/new-project.png')}
        width="500"
    />

1. Remember your project ID. We will refer to it throughout the workshop as `PROJECT_ID`.

    <img
        alt="New Project dialog in highlighting the Project ID text"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-3-nlp/project-id.png')}
        width="300"
    />

1. [Enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to use Google Cloud resources. If you’re a new user, you’re eligible for the [$300 Free Trial](https://cloud.google.com/free) program.
