# Connect to App Services

It's time to connect the web application to Atlas App Services.

1. First, open [Cloud Shell Editor](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshelleditor). The editor may look suspiciously like VSCode. This is because both projects use some of the same open-sourced components such as the Monaco Editor and the Language Server Protocol. You should see your cloned project on the left.

    <img
        alt="Cloud Shell Editor highlighting the project directory on the left hand-side"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/cloud-shell-editor-app-highlighted.png')}
    />

1. Open the **environment.prod.ts** file. You should see the following content.

    ```js title=Google-Cloud-MongoDB-Atlas-Workshop/src/environments/environment.prod.ts
    export const environment = {
      production: true,
      APP_ID: '',
      GRAPHQL_URI: '',
      API_KEY: ''
    };
    ```

    :::note
    Note that you should edit the *environment.**prod**.ts* file and not the *environment.ts* file. The first is used by Angular when building the application for production and the second â€” when building for development.
    :::

1. Add your own credentials to this file. You can either copy them from the open StackBlitz application or follow the instructions from [Chapter 2](/docs/app-services/app-graphql#app-services-authentication-credentials) to get them from App Services.
