# Deploy to Cloud Run

Weâ€™re finally ready to deploy our application! We can do that from the Cloud Shell Editor.

1. Select the **Cloud Run** extension on the left sidebar.

    <img
        alt="Left-hand menu in Cloud Shell highlighting the Cloud Run extension button"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/cloud-run-extension.png')}
    />

1. Click on the Deploy to Cloud Run icon.

    <img
        alt="Deploy to Cloud Run button in the Cloud Run extension"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/deploy-to-cloud-run.png')}
    />

1. Enter the following configuration settings for your service:

    - Service Settings: **Create a service**
    - Service name: **bakery-web-app**
    - Deployment platform: **Cloud Run (fully managed)**
    - Region: **closest to your physical location**
    - Authentication: **Allow unauthenticated invocations**

For the Build environment, select **Cloud Build**.

Finally, in the Build Settings section, select:

- Builder: **Docker**
- Docker: **Google-Cloud-MongoDB-Atlas-Workshop/Dockerfile**

1. Click on the **Deploy** button and wait as your app is being deployed to the cloud! This can take a few minutes. You can expand the process output by clicking on the **Show Detailed Logs** button.

1. When the deployment is complete, you will see the URL for your application. Click on it and you will see the bakery application displaying a list of the cakes in your Atlas database.

    <img
        alt="Deployment output in Cloud Run"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/deployment-output.png')}
    />

    <img
        alt="Bakery application displaying a list of cakes"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/cakes-application.png')}
    />

Great job! You just deployed a web application to the cloud!
