# ðŸ¦¸ Enable Cloud APIs with Cloud Shell

:::tip
This section requires a Google Cloud account. You can create one and get $300 in free credits [here](https://cloud.google.com/free).
Alternatively, you can use this Google Cloud Skills Boost lab â€” [MongoDB Atlas with Natural Language API and Cloud Run](https://mdb.link/gc-lab-2). When you start the lab, you will get access to a temporary Google Cloud account that you can use for the duration of the lab.

Cloud Shell is a command-line environment running Google Cloud. You will be using Cloud Shell to enable Cloud APIs you need for the application deployment.

:::info
Cloud Shell is a powerful tool that will help you greatly in your Google Cloud journey. Itâ€™s a Debian-based virtual machine, preloaded with all the tools you need for Cloud development.

## Configure Cloud Shell

1. Activate Cloud Shell by clicking on the **Activate Cloud Shell** icon.

    <img
        alt="Cloud Console navigation bar highlighting the 'Activate Cloud Shell' button"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/activate-cloud-shell.png')}
    />

1. Find your project ID in the [Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard).

    <img
        alt="New Project dialog in highlighting the Project ID text"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/project-id.png')}
        width="300"
    />

1. Set your project using the `PROJECT_ID`.

    ```sh
    gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
    ```

## Enable the Cloud Run and Cloud Build APIs

1. From Cloud Shell, enable the Cloud Run and Cloud Build APIs

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
    ```

1. If prompted, authorize Cloud Shell to make API calls.

1. You should see a success message similar to this one:

    ```sh
    Operation "operations/acf.cc11252d-30af-47ad-9d59-477a12847c9e" finished successfully.
    ```

1. To see all enabled APIs, you can run:

    ```sh
    gcloud services list
    ```

## Fetch the source code

You need the source code of the app in order to deploy it to Cloud Run. Run `git clone` in the Cloud Shell to fetch the [public Github repository](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/Google-Cloud-MongoDB-Atlas-Workshop).

```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/Google-Cloud-MongoDB-Atlas-Workshop.git
```
