# Set up Google Cloud

In this section, we'll be using the Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyze the sentiment of the comments left on the cakes in the web app. That's why we need to set up a Google Cloud account and project.

1. Sign in to [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started) and create a new project.

    <img
        alt="Select project dropdown in Google Cloud"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-3-nlp/select-project.png')}
        width="500"
    />

    <img
        alt="Dialog box in Google Cloud highlighting the 'New Project' button"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-3-nlp/new-project.png')}
        width="500"
    />

1. Remember your project ID. We will refer to it throughout the workshop as `PROJECT_ID`.

    <img
        alt="New Project dialog in highlighting the Project ID text"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-3-nlp/project-id.png')}
        width="300"
    />

1. [Enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to use Google Cloud resources. If you’re a new user, you’re eligible for the [$300 Free Trial](https://cloud.google.com/free) program.
