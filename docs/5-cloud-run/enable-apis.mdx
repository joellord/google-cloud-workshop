# Enable Cloud APIs with Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a command-line environment running Google Cloud. We’ll be using Cloud Shell to enable Cloud APIs we need for the application deployment.

:::info
Cloud Shell is a powerful tool that will help you greatly in your Google Cloud journey. It’s a Debian-based virtual machine, preloaded with all the tools you need for Cloud development. 
:::

## Configure Cloud Shell

1. Activate Cloud Shell by clicking on the **Activate Cloud Shell** icon.

    <img
        alt="Cloud Console navigation bar highlighting the 'Activate Cloud Shell' button"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/activate-cloud-shell.png')}
    />


1. Find your project ID in the [Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard).

    <img
        alt="New Project dialog in highlighting the Project ID text"
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/chapter-4-cloud-run/project-id.png')}
        width="300"
    />

1. Set your project using the `PROJECT_ID`.

    ```sh
    gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
    ```

## Enable the Cloud Run and Cloud Build APIs

1. From Cloud Shell, enable the Cloud Run and Cloud Build APIs

    ```sh
    gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
    ```

1. If prompted, authorize Cloud Shell to make API calls.

1. You should see a success message similar to this one:

    ```sh
    Operation "operations/acf.cc11252d-30af-47ad-9d59-477a12847c9e" finished successfully.
    ```

1. To see all enabled APIs, you can run:

    ```sh
    gcloud services list
    ```

## Fetch the source code

To deploy our web application, we need its source code. We will use git to fetch the [public Github repository](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/Google-Cloud-MongoDB-Atlas-Workshop).


1. Run the following command inside the Cloud Shell:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/Google-Cloud-MongoDB-Atlas-Workshop.git
    ```
