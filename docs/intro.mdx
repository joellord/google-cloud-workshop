|What tools you'll need|MongoDB Atlas free tier, Google Cloud account|
|Time to complete|2.5h|

MongoDB Atlas is the best way to deploy, manage, and grow MongoDB on Google Cloud! Today, we will build a web application that displays a list of cakes, with the ability to view further details on the cakes and even leave a comment! We will then learn to leverage Atlas App Services products such as Triggers and Functions, to call out to Google Cloud Natural Language API and carry out sentiment analysis on the comments. Finally, we'll deploy our application to Google Cloud Run.

Even better, no prior knowledge of MongoDB or Google Cloud is required!

## Agenda
