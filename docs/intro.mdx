MongoDB Atlas is the best way to deploy, manage, and grow MongoDB on Google Cloud! Today, you will build a web application that displays a list of cakes, with the ability to view further details on the cakes and even leave a comment! You will then learn to leverage Atlas App Services products such as Triggers and Functions, to call out to Google Cloud Natural Language API and carry out sentiment analysis on the comments. Finally, we'll deploy our application to Google Cloud Run.

Even better, no prior knowledge of MongoDB or Google Cloud is required!

## Agenda

1. [MongoDB Atlas: Cloud Database Setup](/docs/category/mongodb-atlas-cloud-database): Get up and running in MongoDB Atlas by creating your first MongoDB Atlas database and inserting our first ever documents.
